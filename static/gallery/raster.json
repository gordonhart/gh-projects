				"The fact that you have an internet connection means that you've probably seen the otherworldly 'dream' images that have been circulating around since the summer of 2015. Thanks to some of the researchers at Google, the world has gotten to see the inner workings of Deep Learning image recongnition software systems.",
				"As soon as I saw the capabilities I knew that I had to try my hand at 'Deepdreaming' images. Turning anything and everything into dogs, cars, and pagodas (the images of which you've surely seen) gets old really, really quickly. However, dig a little deeper (pun intended) and you'll find that Deepdream is capable of far more artistically interesting images.",
				"My favorite effect was achieved by stopping the image processing very early on—immediately after the first pass of edge detection. The computer's attempt to break down objects into streaks looks strikingly familiar...",

I've only gotten as far as the conceptual design phase, and these sprites are some of the proposed characters. Set sometime in the future, the main conflict is between the totalitarian, technologically advanced, and armed to the teeth police force and the gritty neo-rebel good guys."
